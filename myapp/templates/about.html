        <b>Share N Learn</b>  is a Common Platform for Students & Faculties to upload and share - files including study material which will be accessible to all the registered members.
        <br><br>
        The <b>Goal</b> of the project is to create a secure and scalable platform common to both college students and faculties so that they can easily share the files / resources related to coursework , 
        Competitive exams and others hence reducing the dependency on social media platforms.
        In future the platform can also serve as an online library for the college students.
