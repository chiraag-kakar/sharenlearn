**Share N Learn is a Common Platform for Students & Faculties to upload and share - files including all sorts of study material which will be accessible to all the registered members built using [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) Framework.**

The **Goal** of the project is to create a secure and scalable platform common to both college students and faculties so that they can easily share the files / resources related to coursework , 
Competitive exams and others hence reducing the dependency on social media platforms.
In future the platform can also serve as an e-library for the college students.

**So let's grow together.**
