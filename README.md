**Share N Learn is a Common Platform for Students & Faculties to upload and share - files including all sorts of study material which will be accessible to all the registered members built using [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) Framework.**

The **Goal** of the project is to create a secure and scalable platform common to both college students and faculties so that they can easily share the files / resources related to coursework, Competitive exams and others hence reducing the dependency on social media platforms.
In future the platform can also serve as an e-library for the college students.

**So let's grow together.**

### üí°Ô∏è **Pro Tip!** 
  * Always keep your master branch in sync with the main repository (by running `$ git pull upstream master` on your local master branch). 
  * Always create a new branch before making any changes (`$ git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`), never ever make any changes directly on the master branch.
